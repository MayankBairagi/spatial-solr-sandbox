h1. Modules:

h2. spatial4j-solr

Adds Apache Solr support using the lucene-spatial-module. It mostly consists of Field Types; all the real work is implemented in the lucene-spatial-module. If the lucene-spatial-module is officially merged into Apache Lucene then this module will be up for merge consideration next.

(this will be moved to Apache lucene trunk soon)

h2. spatial4j-demo

Contains a demo web application using spatial-solr.  Consumes sample data and "geonames":http://www.geonames.org/export/.
See the provided README.txt in there for instructions to try it out.

h2. History

Lucene-Spatial-Extras began life as "Lucene Spatial Playground":http://code.google.com/p/lucene-spatial-playground/ (LSP) which was migrated to Spatial4j on GitHub and then was broken up such that the Lucene spatial demo + some Lucene/Solr spatial extras were migrated to a new repository -- this one.
