Discuss on the "Spatial4j mailing list":http://spatial4j.16575.n6.nabble.com/ if it's Spatial4j related, else the Lucene/Solr dev list for everything else.

h2. History

"Spatial Solr Sandbox" began life as "Lucene Spatial Playground":http://code.google.com/p/lucene-spatial-playground/
(LSP) which was migrated to "Spatial4j":https://github.com/spatial4j/spatial4j. It was then broken up such that
the demo + some Lucene/Solr spatial extras were migrated to a new repository -- this one.  The vast majority of this code that remains was written by Ryan McKinley.
